We collected 1,000 book cover images captured by 10 different smartphone models. The original images were manually tampered with by five Photoshop (PS) experts. To eliminate inconsistencies between the tampered and original regions, these experts were instructed to use PS tools to post-process the boundaries of the manipulated areas. Ultimately, we compiled a dataset of 1,000 tampered cover images with post-processed boundaries, with image resolutions ranging from 2340×4160 to 3744×4992.

In addition to boundary modifications, experienced forgers may perform arbitrary operations on the tampered regions. Considering this realistic image forgery scenario, we invited another 10 PS experts to manipulate the aforementioned 1,000 original images. They were encouraged to use any suitable operations and tools to make the forged images visually indistinguishable from authentic ones.
